The aim of dh_cme_upgrade is to provide an easy way for a
Debian developer to add better configuration upgrade to the packages
they maintain.

Let's assume that Joe, Debian developer, had seen too many questions
from users regarding configuration upgrades during package
upgrades. Users complains that their settings are lost or that ucf's
questions are too cryptic. So Joe has had enough and wants to add
smooth upgrade capability to his foobar package.

What will the end user see?
----------------------------

Hopefully, just a message during upgrade indicating that Config::Model
is taking care of the upgrade.

What does Joe, Debian developer, have to do?
--------------------------------------------

- ensure that a proper configuration model for the application
  contained in foobar exists. Either:
  - find the package containing the relevant model in Debian
    (something like libconfig-model-foobar-perl)
  - find the package in CPAN and ask debian-perl team to package it
  - write the model. In this case, you may want to subscribe to
    config-model users list (see below)
- ensure that foobar.postinst has a #DEBHELPER# line (if this file
  exists)
- ensure that foobar.control has a dependency on ${misc:Depends}
- ensure that call dh_cme_upgrade during package build.
  Either:
  - run "dh --with cme_upgrade" (**)
  - directly call dh_cme_upgrade. (*)

Note to developer for embedded system: dh_cme_upgrade will do
nothing is DH_NO_ACT is set or if DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains
'noconfigmodel'

CDBS users should add a line like this in rules (*):

build/foo::
  dh_cme_upgrade --model Foo

(**) Alternatively, since cme/1.030-1 you can just build depend on
dh-sequence-cme-upgrade and omit the "--with cme_upgrade" part.

(*) See dh_cme_upgrade man page for more details on usage and
options


How does this work?
--------------------

When called, dh_cme_upgrade will setup foobar package to
upgrade the configuration with Config::Model.

In more details, dh_cme_upgrade will:
- add a dependency on libconfig-model-perl in foobar control file
- add or update foobar.postinst file so that the configuration is
  upgraded. In case of upgrade issue, a message is displayed inviting the
  user to re-run the upgrade command in force and interactive mode.

All these operations are handled by dh_cme_upgrade.
